**Traffic Accident Prediction and High-Risk Area Identification Using Machine Learning**

**Overview**

This project uses machine learning to predict traffic accidents and identify high-risk areas based on traffic patterns, environmental conditions, and spatial data. By proactively pinpointing potential accident hotspots, this model aims to improve road safety through preemptive measures.

**Project Structure**

1.  **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
    
    *   **Data Sources**: Includes historical and real-time data on traffic flows, weather conditions, and past accidents.
        
    *   **Data Preparation**: Data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed for model readiness.
        
2.  **Model Development**:
    
    *   **Algorithms Used**: Utilizes Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Neural Networks for robust predictions.
        
    *   **Training and Evaluation**: Models are trained and validated using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
        
3.  **System Design**:
    
    *   **Architecture**: Integrates real-time data acquisition, predictive analytics, and an interactive user interface for continuous risk assessment.
        
    *   **Scalability**: The system supports real-time processing and can be adapted to various urban settings.
